1 install statify 
    * download from https://github.com/greenpau/statifier
    * in configs/config.x86_64 
        change ELF32             := yes
        to ELF32             := no
    make 
    make install

2 disable ASLR in Linux (https://askubuntu.com/questions/318315/how-can-i-temporarily-disable-aslr-address-space-layout-randomization)
    *So, to disable it, run

        echo 0 | sudo tee /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space    
    
    *This won't survive a reboot, so you'll have to configure this in sysctl. Add a file /etc/sysctl.d/01-disable-aslr.conf containing:

        kernel.randomize_va_space = 0


3 use statify to creat static-linked version of executable
    example: 
    
    statifier ./bin/gold_digger ./bin/static_gold_digger

Now the static_gold_digger should contain all the shared libraries.
